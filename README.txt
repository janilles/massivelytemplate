This is website repository for the London-based non-profit project The Shed, which takes kindly donated muisical instruments – old or new, proudly used or painfully neglected – and puts them into the hands of musicians and songwriters whose passion and potential are limited only by the fact that they don’t have good instruments of their own.

If you have any ideas or tips for improvement of the website - or the project - please do get in touch.
