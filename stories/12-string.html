									<h1>So many ideas <br />
										in 12 strings</h1>
									<p>“I love this guitar. The sound is so rich, full, beautiful and vibrant, and I love how my voice sounds with it. <br />
										It’s giving me more ideas of more songs that I can write, and it’s so wonderful to play. <br/>
										Thank you so much for  opening up more avenues for me.”</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/12string.jpg" alt="" /></span>This is how Sian, a student at <a href="http://worldheartbeat.org/" target="_blank">World Heart Beat</a>, described the instrument generously given to us by Guy Hart.</p>
								<p>Guy also liked the jangly sound of the 12 strings, but after a while he found that he wasn’t playing it all that often. So when he came across our page on Facebook he thought he would send it to a new home where it would be appreciated and played more.</p>
								<p>“I remembered how desperately I wanted the right kind of guitar as a schoolboy and how frustrating it was to have to wait until I was older to have my own money to buy one with.</p>
								<p>“I had been bought a classical guitar and given classical lessons at an early age, which I am grateful for now. But my heroes were people like Jimi Hendrix (who I still love), so a classical guitar wasn’t really the right instrument for me. By the time I bought the 12-string, I was a lot older and I had a few guitars already. I fancied trying something new though to give me some new inspiration.”</p>
								<blockquote>"I'm pleased it's being put to good use by others and I hope it will contribute to their musical journey."</blockquote>
