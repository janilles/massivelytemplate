										Once upon a time, in Arlon, Belgium...</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/katia.png" alt="" /></span>As the daughter of an organist, I grew up in a house filled with music. When my dad played at home or in concert I used to turn the pages of the score for him even though I couldn’t read music. I just followed the gaze of his eyes and somehow it worked.</b></p>
								<p>That was pretty good but when I turned 16 I wanted more. I wanted to make some more “noise” in the family so my dad gave me an acoustic guitar.</p>
								<p>I spent two years playing in a small teaching group but because I never really practiced outside the class I wasn’t particularly good. But I did enjoy it and I even played in front of my family once, with my sister singing along with me.</p>
								<p>When I left home for my studies, I took my guitar with me but it pretty much stayed in its case in the corner of my student room untouched for 4 years. Then I took it back to my parents’ place and forgot about it.</p>
								<p>Last year I moved to London where I met Jan and Steve, the guys who started The Shed (back then called Guitar Giving) and I instantly fell in love with the project. I understood that I could give a much better life to the wonderful instrument which was sleeping in my parents’ loft and, even more importantly, that it will make someone really happy.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/katias.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My guitar found a new loving home at the <a href="http://worldheartbeat.org/guitar-giving-donation" target="_blank">World Heart Beat Music Academy</a> and I’m really pleased with that.</p>
